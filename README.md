# Classification: Spam Email Detection

## Overview

This project showcases a basic implementation of a random forest classifier for spam email detection. The code uses a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes.

    |-- README.md
```

## Files

### `classification_model.py`

This Python script performs the following tasks:

- Generates a synthetic dataset with email text and corresponding labels indicating whether the email is spam or not.
- Converts text data into numerical features (for simplicity, using word presence).
- Splits the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Creates and trains a random forest classifier using scikit-learn.
- Makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- Visualizes the confusion matrix.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd classification_project
    ```

3. Install necessary packages:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

4. Run the classification model script:

    ```bash
    python src/classification_model.py
    ```

5. Examine the results:

    - The script will print the accuracy of the model.
    - A confusion matrix will be displayed, visualizing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values.

## Notes

- This project uses a synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace it with your own dataset.
- Adjust the code as needed for your specific use case, including customizing the feature extraction process and incorporating a more diverse dataset.

Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL of your Git repository if you plan to host the code on a version control platform. Customize the README further based on your preferences and specific use case.
